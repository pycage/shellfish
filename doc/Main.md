# Shellfish Declarative Toolkit

## Introduction

In short, Shellfish is a **declarative toolkit** for JavaScript environments and targets
**full-stack development**. This means, it covers both, the client UI and the server side.

Its runtime has **no additional dependencies** and works on any compatible JavaScript
runtime environment, including:

* Modern web browsers
* Node.js
* Runtime environments like Electron or Capacitor

Shellfish also features Shui, a **modeling language** taking full advantage
of Shellfish's declarative nature.

This is what the obligatory "Hello, world!" example could look like in Shui code:

```
require "shellfish/ui";

Document {

    title: "Hello, world of declarative programming!"

    Label {
        text: parent.title
    }

}
```

Shui code is translated to JavaScript code before execution. This can either
happen on the fly as the code gets loaded, or on the server-side on demand, 
or even by shipping only pre-translated code. It's your choice.

  can be used to create a simple prefix test for the `when` predicate.

### November 2023
* `require.js` is now the same as `require2.js` and `require2.js` is going to be
  removed eventually. The previous version of `require.js` is currently available as
  `requireLegacy.js`.
* The element {@link core.TreeModelAdapter} has a new property `dynamicContentProvider`
  for populating the model with content dynamically when uncollapsing a node.
* The new element {@link core.RegistryFile} provides a file-backed easy-to-use
  hierarchical registry database for storing configurations.
* The new element {@link core.RegistryOverlay} provides an overlay over a
  registry for temporary changes that can then be either applied or cancelled.
* It is now possible in Shui code to assign `Promise` objects to properties, and the
  property will be set when the `Promise` resolves.

### October 2023
* The element {@link ui.Button} is now stylable with templates.
* The new function {@link core.formatBytes} can be used to format a bytes
  number to a human-readable string.

* The `modelData` property is now only defined on elements where needed. This
  makes it possible to access the `modelData` property of a delegate from
  further down the hierarchy.
* The element {@link core.RpcProxy} now has a `status` property for monitoring
  the connection status.
* The new elements {@link core.TreeModelAdapter} and {@link ui.TreeBranch} help

  via the resolver function in Shui code and no longer take up a property.
  Thus, the `this...` references are now available for all elements in
  Shui code.
* The new keyword `unresolved` can be used before JavaScript blocks in Shui to
  process the block as unresolved, i.e. without the Shui resolver overhead.
* Elements derived from {@link html.Item} have new shortcut properties `fill`
  and `margins` for setting `fillWidth` and `fillHeight`, respectively
  `marginTop`, `marginBottom`, `marginLeft`, `marginRight` to the same value.
* **API-Break:** The file data returned by {@link core.Filesystem#read} and

  which may be used to abort the waiting anytime via the method
  {@link core.Object#abortWait}.
* The new elements {@link core.Action}, {@link core.SequentialAction},
  {@link core.ParallelAction}, {@link core.ScriptAction}, and
  {@link core.WaitAction} let you setup schedules of actions.
  The element {@link html.ScriptAction} moved to {@link core.ScriptAction}.

  the Shellfish module manager. It should replace the old one when ready.

### May 2023
* The new elements {@link server.RpcSession} and {@link html.RpcProxy} allow
  for a HTTP-based asynchronous RPC connection between client and server.
* The method {@link html.Document#httpRequest} creates a HTTP request with
  progress monitoring. It acts as a replacement for the `fetch` command.
  The property `maxHttpRequests` limits the number of simultaneous HTTP requests.
* **API-Break:** The `when` function property of {@link server.HTTPRoute} takes
  a {@link server.HTTPServer.HTTPRequestEvent} object now.

### April 2023

  to wait in a named queue. The method {@link core.Object#clearQueue} clears a
  named queue, cancelling all waiting actions.
* It is now possible to build Shellfish packages with ES2015 syntax for running
  in legacy environments by using the Babel compiler while bundling.
  Pass the `--legacy` option to `make-bundle.js` to enable.
* **API Break:** The element {@link ui.FSItem} has no property `filesystem`
  anymore. The path given to `thumbnail` is an URL now, e.g. a Blob URL.

  by `shellfish/declarative` for better element creation performance with Shui.
* Elements derived from {@link html.Item} have the new bounding box properties
  `bboxX`, `bboxY`, `bboxWidth`, and `bboxHeight`. Using these usually gives a
  better performance than referencing particular members of the `bbox` property.

  for use in 3D scenes.

### May 2022
* **API Break:** The module `shellfish/high` is now named `shellfish/declarative`.
  Since this module is usually not imported directly by application code,
  applications should not be affected by this API break.
* WebAssembly is now directly supported by the module loader, so WASM modules
  may be loaded like any other Shellfish module or JavaScript file.
  The element {@link core.Wasm} is thus deprecated and should not be used in new
  code. It will be removed eventually.
* The new method {@link core.Object#import} imports JavaScript, CSS, or WASM
  modules dynamically.

### April 2022
* The new method {@link core.Object#log} provides a simple means for controlling
  application logging.
* The new method {@link server.HTTPResponse#enableCrossOriginIsolation} provides
  a comfortable way to set the HTTP headers for cross-origin-isolation on a HTTP
  response.
* The examples gallery is now included in the main distribution.
* The module `shellfish/3d` is now included in the main distribution.

### February 2022
* The `function` keyword may now be used in JavaScript sections of Shui files.
* Shellfish is expanding its reach to the server-side to allow full-stack
  implementations with declarative Shui code and the new `shellfish-server` API.
* **API Break:** The module `shellfish/mid` is now named `shellfish/html` and is
  no longer imported by default in Shui documents. Shui modules with UI code
  should import `shellfish/ui` (which includes `shellfish/html`).
* The method {@link ui.Menu#popup} accepts `null` as the `parent` parameter to
  open the menu near the mouse pointer.
* The element {@link html.Document} has the new non-notifyable properties `pointerX`
  and `pointerY` for accessing the document-global pointer coordinates.

  is connected. Compatibility issues with the Sailfish Browser have been fixed.
* The element {@link ui.SplitBox} has the new properties `orientation` for
  changing the layout orientation, and `flip` for flipping both containers.
  The new property `splitRatio` lets you change the split ratio programmatically.
